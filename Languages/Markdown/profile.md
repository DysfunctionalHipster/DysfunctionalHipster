## ✏️ About Me

Hey there! I'm a web developer based in Brussels however I have a deep love of travel. I'm currently undergoing a training program with **BeCode** in Brussels and with the **London App Brewery**. I'm passionate about **Web 3.0** technologies and principles and about what they can do to make the world a better place.

## 💡 Projects I'd love to collaborate on

I'm interested in any project that is aimed at helping the world. Especially interested by any start-ups that are working on implementing web3 technologies to their business model.
