# Welcome to Markdown

## Basics
Type as you would in any other text editor to write plain text. _Italicise using an underscore before and after the content_ . **And to put content in bold just use the double asterisks before and after** and then for lists:
- Just use a hyphen
- an asterisks or a 
- plus sign before every list item
- Like so
- It's super easy.

> This is a blockquote, you can do this
> using a > in front of every line of the blockquote.
